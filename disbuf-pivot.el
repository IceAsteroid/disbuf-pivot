;;; disbuf-pivot.el --- Choose where to display a buffer the selected window cannot display  -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:
;; The package is `disbuf-pivot'; `disbuf' is the short form of
;; `display-buffer', and the pivot is the display target: a window, a
;; tab or a frame.
;;
;; When the selected window cannot display a buffer -- it is dedicated
;; or a side window -- the window the buffer goes to is
;; Emacs's choice, made by its default action functions, so the buffer
;; lands where the user does not expect it.  `disbuf-pivot-action-mode'
;; replaces that with one rule and one choice: a buffer is displayed in a
;; window that already displays it, else in the selected window, and a
;; buffer the selected window cannot display is displayed in a new window
;; when `disbuf-pivot-window-utility-split-p' says a split is preferred, else in a window
;; the user chooses with `ace-window' -- choosing again while the chosen
;; window is one that cannot display it either.  A call that asks for a
;; tab or a frame is asked which one, or a new one, and the window inside
;; it is chosen with `aw-select' after a window that already displays the
;; buffer is used.
;;
;; The mode conses one `display-buffer-alist' entry at the front of the
;; list, matched by every buffer an earlier entry does not take.  Priority
;; is list order, and a package conses its entry at the front when its
;; mode is enabled, so enable a popup manager's mode after this one when
;; its rule is to take precedence for its buffers.  A request whose alist
;; names a place for the buffer -- a window, a direction, a side, a slot,
;; a tab or a frame -- is left to the caller's own action functions.

the window it displays, and a caller that does not select leaves the
selection alone.
